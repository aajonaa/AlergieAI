Wear a medical alert bracelet\n\n**Note:** Peanuts are legumes, not tree nuts, but cross-reactivity can occur. Discuss with your allergist whether you need to avoid peanuts as well."}
{"instruction": "How is anaphylaxis treated?", "input": "", "output": "Anaphylaxis is a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction that requires immediate treatment:\n\n**First-Line Treatment - Epinephrine:**\n1. Inject epinephrine (EpiPen, Auvi-Q) into the outer thigh immediately\n2. Can be given through clothing if necessary\n3. Call emergency services (911) even if symptoms improve\n4. A second dose may be needed after 5-15 minutes if symptoms persist\n\n**Additional Emergency Care:**\n- Lay the person flat (elevate legs if possible)\n- If breathing is difficult, allow them to sit up\n- Loosen tight clothing\n- If unconscious, place in recovery position\n- Begin CPR if no pulse or breathing\n\n**Hospital Treatment May Include:**\n- Additional epinephrine\n- Antihistamines (H1 and H2 blockers)\n- Corticosteroids (to prevent biphasic reaction)\n- Bronchodilators for breathing difficulties\n- IV fluids for blood pressure support\n- Oxygen therapy\n\n**Prevention:**\n- Strictly avoid known allergens\n- Always carry two epinephrine auto-injectors\n- Wear medical alert identification\n- Have an anaphylaxis action plan\n- Educate family, friends, and caregivers\n\n**Important:** Epinephrine is the ONLY first-line treatment for anaphylaxis.

{"instruction": "What is oral immunotherapy (OIT) for food allergies?", "input": "", "output": "Oral Immunotherapy (OIT) is a treatment approach to reduce sensitivity to food allergens:\n\n**How OIT Works:**\n- Patient consumes gradually increasing amounts of the allergen\n- Starts with microscopic doses (e.g., 1/1000th of a peanut)\n- Doses increase every 1-2 weeks under medical supervision\n- Process typically takes 6-12 months to reach maintenance dose\n- Aims to desensitize the immune system\n\n**Goals of OIT:**\n1. **Desensitization:** Raise the threshold for allergic reactions\n2. **Bite-proof protection:** Protection against accidental exposure\n3. **Sustained unresponsiveness:** (in some cases) Long-term tolerance\n\n**FDA-Approved OIT:**\n- Palforzia (peanut allergen powder) - approved for peanut allergy in ages 4-17\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Reduces risk from accidental exposure\n- May improve quality of life\n- Can reduce anxiety around food\n\n**Risks and Considerations:**\n- Allergic reactions during treatment (common)\n- Requires strict adherence to dosing schedule\n- Not a cure - most need ongoing maintenance\n- Not suitable for everyone\n- Must be done under allergist supervision\n\n**Alternatives:**\n- Sublingual Immunotherapy (SLIT) - allergen under the tongue\n- Epicutaneous Immunotherapy (EPIT) - skin patches\n\nConsult with a board-certified allergist to determine if OIT is right for you."}
